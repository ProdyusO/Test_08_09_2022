    For releasing this test, I needed to extend proposed model User by add password to get current_user and wrote the simple authorize system.
    All test's tasks were completed with Advanced tasks too.
        To run app:
            - git clone https://github.com/ProdyusO/Test_08_09_2022.git;
            - docker build -t myimage;
            - docker run -d --name mycontainer -p 80:80 myimage.
            - /localhost:80.
